# Data Structures & Algorithms Practice

## Introduction
Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) portfolio**.  
This repository is a curated collection of my work, demonstrating a systematic approach to learning the fundamental concepts of computer science and applying them to **practical, interview-style problems**.

The solutions are implemented in both:  
- **C++** → for foundational understanding and performance.  
- **Python** → for rapid, idiomatic problem-solving.

## Repository Structure

- **cpp/**: Focuses on performance and deep understanding of the mechanics of each data structure.  
  - **coursework/**: Contains structured implementations of core data structures and algorithms, following Abdul Bari’s DSA course.
  - **patterns/**: Solutions organized by reusable **coding patterns** (e.g., Sliding Window, Two Pointers).
  - **miscellaneous_practice/**: It contains a collection of mixed practice problems, i used to do initially.

- **python/**: Contains Python solutions, emphasizing clean, efficient, and "Pythonic" approaches.

This structure allows for a clear view of **theoretical understanding**, **strategic pattern application**, and **continuous practical drilling**.
