# Data Structures & Algorithms Practice

## ðŸ“– Introduction
Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) portfolio**.  
This repository is a curated collection of my work, demonstrating a systematic approach to mastering the fundamental concepts of computer science and applying them to **practical, interview-style problems**.

The solutions are implemented in both:  
- **C++** â†’ for foundational understanding and performance.  
- **Python** â†’ for rapid, idiomatic problem-solving.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure


- **cpp/**: Focuses on performance and deep understanding of the mechanics of each data structure.  
  - **coursework/**: Implementations of core data structures and algorithms from a structured course of study.  
  - **problems/**: Solutions to practical challenges from platforms like LeetCode and other sources.  

- **python/**: Contains Python solutions, emphasizing clean, efficient, and "Pythonic" approaches.
