# C++ Data Structures & Algorithms

This directory contains my C++ solutions, separated by their learning objective.  
The focus is on creating **correct, efficient, and well-documented implementations**.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Breakdown

### `coursework/`
This folder contains my implementations of **fundamental data structures and algorithms**, organized by topic (e.g., Arrays, LinkedLists, Trees).  
The code here is the result of a **comprehensive, structured course of study** and serves as my **library of foundational concepts**.

### `problems/`
This folder contains my solutions to **practical, interview-style problems** from platforms like **LeetCode** and other competitive programming sources.  
Each solution here is an **application of the foundational concepts** learned in the `coursework/` section.
