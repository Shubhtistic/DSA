# ⚡ C++ Data Structures & Algorithms

This directory contains my C++ solutions, separated by their learning objective.  
The focus is on creating **correct, efficient, and well-documented implementations**.

## 📂 Folder Breakdown

### `coursework/`
This folder contains my implementations of **fundamental data structures and algorithms**, organized by topic (e.g., Arrays, LinkedLists, Trees).  
The code here is the result of a **comprehensive, structured course of study** and serves as a **Collection of foundational concepts**.

### `patterns/`
This folder is the **primary focus** of my problem-solving journey.  
It contains solutions systematically organized by **coding patterns** (e.g., Sliding Window, Two Pointers). Each solution here is optimized to demonstrate the underlying pattern rather than just solving the problem.

### `miscellaneous_practice/` 
It contains a collection of mixed practice problems i used to do initially.
